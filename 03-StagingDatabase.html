    <h1>3. Staging Database</h1>

<p>The Staging Database serves as a temporary storage layer for all data submitted through the Public Onboarding Form. This layer allows administrators to review and validate the data before transferring it to the master dataset.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<ul>
<li>To ensure data quality by allowing for manual or automated validation steps.</li>
<li>To temporarily store information on contacts and patients before their final inclusion in the master dataset.</li>
<li>To allow for deduplication and verification of data entries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Flow</h2>

<ol>
<li>Form submissions from the Public Onboarding Form are automatically persisted in the Staging Database.</li>
<li>Data remains in the Staging Database until it is processed into the RettDB data model.</li>
<li>Once data is validated and confirmed, it is transferred into the master database, where it becomes part of the main dataset.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Validation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Validation steps can include checking for duplicate records (e.g., patients with the same name and birthdate) and verifying the integrity of the provided MECP2 mutation data.</li>
<li>Administrators can review submissions through the backoffice interface before finalizing the transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
<li>Data in the Staging Database is retained until reviewed and processed. After processing, staging data can be either archived or deleted, based on retention policies.</li>
</ul>
