# 11. Reporting and Analytics

This section covers the reporting and analytics capabilities provided by the system, with a focus on patient demographics, mutations, and relationships.

## PowerBI Dashboard
- Provides real-time reporting on data such as:
  - Number of registered patients.
  - Age groups and demographic distribution.
  - MECP2 mutation statuses and other genetic data.

## Custom Reports
- Administrators can generate custom reports based on specific filters (e.g., all patients with a clinical diagnosis, patients under 5 years old).
- Reports can be exported to CSV for sharing with external stakeholders or further analysis.

## Anonymized Data Exports
- All reports are anonymized to protect the privacy of patients and contacts.
- Sensitive fields such as names, emails, and birthdates are hashed or removed.
