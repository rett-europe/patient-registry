# Overview

The Rett Syndrome Patient Registry aims to collect and manage contact and patient information for the purpose of building a robust dataset that supports research, patient care, and further awareness of Rett Syndrome.

## Objectives
- To create a simple onboarding process for legal guardians to add new patients without requiring authentication.
- To securely store and manage contacts, patients, and their relationships in a centralized database.
- To provide a backoffice interface for managing data with CRUD capabilities.

## Key Stakeholders
- Legal Guardians (providing patient data, without access to the backoffice)
- Backoffice Administrators (managing data)
- Researchers and other stakeholders (end users of the data, but not interacting with the onboarding system directly, only access to anonymized data)
