<hr />

<h2>1. Content Management System (CMS) - WordPress</h2>

<p>The WordPress CMS serves as the public frontend for the registry, handling public-facing content and facilitating initial data intake via forms. This CMS setup is chosen for its simplicity, ease of maintenance, and extensive plugin ecosystem, making it ideal for hosting and managing content updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> WordPress (hosted on WordPress.com using Business subscription)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Public website for informational content and registry landing page</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>2. Front-end for users</h2>

<p>We will implement a private area for users to login and maintain their profile. It will also allow users to create, edit and delete patient records.</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Secure Authentication - Auth0</h2>

<p>The registry employs Auth0 for passwordless, secure authentication. Auth0 simplifies login management, allowing for secure access without traditional passwords, and supports two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Authentication and identity management.</li>
<li><strong>Integration:</strong> Enables secure access to both WordPress and the backend services.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>3. Orchestrator - Azure Functions</h2>

<p>Azure Functions act as the backend for the registry system, managing key processes such as data validation, storage, form submissions, and file uploads. Serving as the backend for PowerApps, Azure Functions support CRUD operations and enable real-time data interactions. They are triggered by events like form submissions, file uploads, and PowerApps requests, processing and securely routing data to Azure SQL or Blob Storage as needed.</p>

<p>This serverless, scalable setup ensures efficient processing while adapting to demand, maintaining high performance, and supporting seamless integration across the registry system.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Data processing, orchestration of backend tasks, and handling API requests.</li>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Integrates with Auth0 for authentication, handles data storage in Azure SQL, and triggers events for file uploads.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact Endpoints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>POST /contacts</code></strong>: Creates a new contact.</li>
<li><strong><code>GET /contacts/{id}</code></strong>: Retrieves contact information.</li>
<li><strong><code>PUT /contacts/{id}</code></strong>: Updates contact details.</li>
<li><strong><code>DELETE /contacts/{id}</code></strong>: Soft deletes a contact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Relationship Endpoints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>POST /relationships</code></strong>: Links a contact to a patient.</li>
<li><strong><code>DELETE /relationships/{id}</code></strong>: Deletes a specific patient-contact relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>3.1.3. File Management</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>POST /files/upload</code></strong>: Accepts file uploads linked to a patient or contact, storing files securely in Blob Storage.</li>
<li><strong><code>GET /files/{id}</code></strong>: Retrieves files associated with a specific patient or contact.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.1.4. Survey and Data Collection</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>POST /surveys/submitResponse</code></strong>: Captures and stores responses from surveys, linking data back to the appropriate patient or contact.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.1.5. Notifications and Reminders</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>POST /notifications/sendEmail</code></strong>: Sends email notifications (e.g., for onboarding confirmation, survey invites).</li>
<li><strong><code>POST /notifications/sendSMS</code></strong>: Sends SMS notifications for reminders or verifications as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Storage</h2>

<h3>4.1. NoSQL database - Azure Cosmos DB</h3>

<p>The primary database for the registry, Azure Cosmos DB stores patient, contact, and relationship data securely. It offers flexibility for structuring longitudinal data and supports scalability for future analytical needs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Storing structured and unstructured data like patient demographics, contact relationships, and survey responses.</li>
<li><strong>Schema:</strong> Initial data model setup through JSON documents (with Terraform setup for initial provisioning).</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2. File storage - Azure Blob Storage</h3>

<p>Azure Blob Storage securely stores uploaded files (e.g., genetic reports) linked to patients. Blob Storage provides scalable and secure file management, essential for large files and GDPR-compliant storage practices.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Secure storage for files associated with patient records.</li>
<li><strong>File Management:</strong> Files are linked via metadata in Azure SQL, enabling easy retrieval for processing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.2.1. Access Management</h4>

<p>Blob Storage access is secured with several key controls:<br />
* SAS Tokens: Temporary access is granted using Shared Access Signatures (SAS), generated by the backend to restrict file access based on user roles.<br />
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC ensures that only specific system components, like backend services, can write or delete files, with limited permissions granted as needed.<br />
* Network Restrictions: Private endpoints and firewall rules restrict access to known IPs within our virtual network, minimizing exposure to the public internet.</p>

<h4>4.2.2. Encryption</h4>

<p>To ensure data protection, Blob Storage applies encryption both at rest and in transit:<br />
* Encryption at Rest: All files are encrypted automatically using Microsoft-managed keys (AES-256).<br />
* Encryption in Transit: HTTPS/TLS encryption secures data transfer to and from Blob Storage, protecting data confidentiality during upload and download.</p>
