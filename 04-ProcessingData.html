    <h1>4. Processing Data</h1>

<p>The process of moving data from the Staging Database to the Master Data is handled via an internal GUI tool that allows administrators to validate and review submissions.</p>

<h2>Data Review</h2>

<ul>
<li>Administrators access the Staging Database through an internal tool that displays pending submissions.</li>
<li>Each submission is reviewed to ensure all required fields are present and accurate.</li>
<li>Data related to contacts and patients is validated, including checks for duplicates and data consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transfer to Master Database</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once validated, the data is processed into the RettDB data model.</li>
<li>For each submission, contact and patient records are created or updated in the master database.</li>
<li>Relationships between contacts and patients are established (e.g., mother-daughter, legal guardian, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logic for Managing Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Duplication Check</strong>: During the processing phase, checks are performed to prevent duplicate patients or contacts from being added.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Management</strong>: The system ensures that relationships between contacts and patients are correctly established, with the possibility of one contact being linked to multiple patients and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Error Handling</h2>

<ul>
<li>In case of validation errors (e.g., missing required fields, invalid data), submissions can be flagged for further review.</li>
<li>Administrators can request more information from the contact before completing the data transfer.</li>
</ul>
