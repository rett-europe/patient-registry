<h1>7. Longitudinal Data Collection</h1>

<p>The longitudinal data collection process allows for gathering ongoing data for each patient at different points in time, through surveys. This process is crucial for tracking changes and updates in the patients' condition, genetic information, and treatments over time.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Select a Subset of Patients</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>An administrator selects a target group of patients from the master database. This selection is based on certain criteria such as patient demographics, mutation status, or previous survey responses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Generate Private Links for Surveys</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>A process generates individual tokens for each contact-patient pair.</li>
<li>Each token is linked to a specific survey and patient, ensuring that the survey is unique and can only be submitted once by the contact.</li>
<li>These tokens are stored in the Tokens table and are associated with both contacts and patients.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Send Email Notifications</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Automated emails are sent to the selected contacts.</li>
<li>Each email contains a unique survey link generated by the token system, which directs the contact to the survey page.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Receive and Process Survey Responses</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Once the survey is completed, the response is stored with the corresponding token.</li>
<li>The survey responses are linked to the correct patient in the master database, ensuring that longitudinal data is properly maintained for each patient.</li>
<li>This allows multiple surveys to be associated with the same patient, forming a longitudinal data set.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Association</h2>

<li>The system allows filtering based on criteria such as age, mutation type, or previous survey responses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Token-Based Survey Distribution</h2>

<ul>
<li>For each selected patient, the system generates a unique token tied to the contact associated with the patient.</li>
<li>This token is used to create a private, one-time link for the survey, ensuring that only the designated contact can submit a response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact Authentication and Verification</h2>

<p>To comply with regulatory requirements, the system includes a mechanism to verify that the survey is completed by the designated contact:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Token Verification</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>The survey link is unique to each contact-patient pair and can only be used once. Each link contains an embedded token that is verified before the survey is opened.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before completing the survey, the contact is required to verify their identity using a second factor of authentication (2FA), such as an SMS code or authentication app.</li>
<li>This ensures that only the authorized contact can access and complete the survey.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit Trail</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The system records a detailed audit trail for each survey submission, including the identity of the contact who submitted the survey, the timestamp, and any authentication steps completed.</li>
<li>This guarantees compliance with regulatory requirements and provides accountability for the data submitted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consent Confirmation</strong>:</p>

<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Temporary File Storage</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Uploaded files are stored temporarily while OpenAI processes them.</li>
<li>Once the key data is extracted, the files are securely deleted from the system to avoid long-term storage.</li>
<li>A retention policy ensures that files are only kept for the minimum time required for processing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Doctor Review and Validation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After OpenAI extracts the key data, the system can notify a designated doctor to review and validate the diagnosis.</li>
<li>The doctor receives a secure, token-based link to access the patient’s report and the extracted data.</li>
<li>The doctor reviews the report, analyzes the provided diagnostic information, and can validate or add comments to the diagnosis.</li>
<li>The doctor’s validation is securely logged and linked to the patient’s record in the database.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Linking</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The extracted data, along with any validation from the doctor, is linked to the appropriate patient in the master database.</li>
<li>Only the essential extracted information and doctor’s validation are stored, ensuring that database size is minimized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GDPR Compliance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The file upload, data extraction, and validation processes adhere to GDPR standards.</li>
<li>Contacts must give explicit consent before uploading files.</li>
<li>Files and extracted data are encrypted both at rest and in transit, and unnecessary data is securely deleted after processing.</li>

<h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>

<p>The auditing system is designed to ensure full compliance with various regulations, including:
- <strong>GDPR</strong>: All access and data management actions are logged, ensuring that data processing is transparent and auditable.
- <strong>HIPAA</strong> (if applicable): All interactions with patient data are logged and protected, ensuring compliance with healthcare-related regulations.
- <strong>Consent Tracking</strong>: For all sensitive actions (e.g., data submission, file uploads), consent logs are maintained to prove compliance with privacy laws.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Data Security for Audit Logs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable Logs</strong>: Audit logs are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: All audit logs are encrypted both at rest and in transit to ensure they are securely stored.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Only authorized personnel with specific auditing privileges can view or generate audit reports.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Backups</strong>: Audit logs are backed up regularly to prevent data loss and ensure availability during audits.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Data Retention Policies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Audit logs are retained for a period specified by regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).</li>
<li>After the retention period, logs may be archived but will remain accessible for legal or regulatory audits.</li>
<li>All audit data will be securely deleted after the legally required retention period if no further use is mandated.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Audit Review and Reporting</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audit Reports</strong>: Administrators or authorized personnel can generate detailed audit reports to review all activities, ensuring compliance.</li>
<li><strong>External Review</strong>: The system supports exporting audit logs for review by external auditors or regulatory bodies.</li>
</ul>

<h1>14. Consent Management</h1>

<p>The European Rett Syndrome Patient Registry places a high priority on ensuring that all data collection activities comply with GDPR regulations, particularly with respect to obtaining explicit consent from participants or their legal guardians. This section outlines the processes for managing and tracking consent throughout the registry.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Consent Collection</h2>

<p>Consent is required before any personal or sensitive data can be collected from participants or their legal guardians. This includes demographic information, genetic data, medical history, and caregiver information.</p>

<h3>Key Principles:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit Consent</strong>: Consent must be clearly and explicitly given by the participant or legal guardian. No data is collected without this.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Consent</strong>: Participants are provided with full details of how their data will be used, who will have access to it, and their rights under GDPR.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Withdraw</strong>: Participants have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Upon withdrawal, their data will be anonymized or deleted as required by GDPR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Consent is Obtained:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Online Forms</strong>: Consent is collected through the public onboarding forms, where participants or legal guardians are required to check a box confirming their agreement with the data usage terms.</li>
<li><strong>File Uploads</strong>: Before uploading any documents (e.g., genetic reports), participants are required to give consent for the processing and storage of these files.</li>
<li><strong>Surveys</strong>: Each survey sent to participants is accompanied by a clear consent prompt, ensuring that participants understand how their responses will be used.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Consent Tracking and Documentation</h2>

<p>To ensure compliance, the system tracks and stores detailed information about each consent provided by participants. This information is maintained in the system as long as it is legally required.</p>

<h3>Consent Tracking Includes:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date and Time of Consent</strong>: The exact timestamp when consent was given.</li>
<li><strong>Form or Action</strong>: The specific form or action (e.g., survey submission, onboarding, file upload) that required consent.</li>
<li><strong>Participant Details</strong>: The identity of the participant or legal guardian who provided the consent.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address</strong>: When necessary, the IP address from which consent was given may be logged for additional verification.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logs</strong>: All consent actions are recorded in an audit log for compliance and accountability purposes.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Consent for Minors and Legal Guardianship</h2>

<p>In cases where the participant is a minor or unable to provide consent on their own, legal guardians are responsible for providing consent. The system accommodates this by allowing legal guardians to act on behalf of the patient.</p>

<h3>Key Provisions:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Guardian Consent</strong>: Legal guardians must explicitly confirm their status and provide consent on behalf of the minor or dependent.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Additional verification steps may be taken to ensure that the person providing consent is the authorized legal guardian.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Right to Withdraw Consent</h2>

<p>Participants or legal guardians have the right to withdraw consent at any time, in accordance with GDPR. The system is designed to facilitate this process smoothly.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal Process:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request for Withdrawal</strong>: Participants can submit a withdrawal request via the registry’s contact options or through the system's user interface.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymization</strong>: Upon withdrawal, all personally identifiable information will be anonymized, ensuring that the participant’s data cannot be traced back to them.</li>
<li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: In cases where anonymization is not feasible, the data will be securely deleted from the system, and a record of the withdrawal will be stored in the audit logs.</li>
<li><strong>Confirmation</strong>: Once the withdrawal is processed, the participant or legal guardian will receive confirmation that their data has been removed or anonymized.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Compliance with GDPR</h2>

<p>The consent management process fully complies with GDPR, ensuring that participants are informed, their consent is obtained and tracked properly, and their right to withdraw is respected.</p>

<h3>GDPR Key Requirements:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Participants are fully informed of how their data will be used.</li>
<li><strong>Data Minimization</strong>: Only the necessary data is collected, and participants are made aware of the scope.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Access</strong>: Participants have the right to request access to the data collected on them, including their consent records.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Erasure</strong>: Participants can request the erasure of their data if they withdraw consent or if the data is no longer necessary for the registry’s purposes.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Auditing and Accountability</h2>

<p>All consent actions, including the provision and withdrawal of consent, are logged in the audit trail. This provides a clear record for regulatory bodies and helps ensure the registry’s compliance with legal and ethical standards.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audit Logs</strong>: Every consent-related action is recorded, ensuring that compliance with GDPR is verifiable.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Internal and external audits can be conducted to verify that consent is being managed in line with regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Ongoing Consent Review</h2>

<p>As the project evolves and new features are added, participants or their legal guardians may be asked to re-confirm their consent if new types of data are collected or if the data use changes.</p>
