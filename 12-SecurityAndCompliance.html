    <h1>12. Security and Compliance</h1>

<p>This section outlines the security and compliance measures for the Rett Syndrome Patient Registry, ensuring GDPR compliance and the protection of sensitive data.</p>

<h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Backoffice Access</strong>: Access to the backoffice is restricted to authorized personnel only, using Microsoft 365 authentication (or other OAuth systems).</li>
<li><strong>Role-based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: Permissions are granted based on user roles, such as Admin or Data Manager, with different levels of access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Minimization</strong>: Only necessary data is collected from contacts and patients.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Consent</strong>: All contacts must give explicit consent for data collection, as per GDPR requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Erasure</strong>: Contacts and patients have the right to request their data be removed from the system.</li>
<li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: All sensitive data (e.g., patient medical records, genetic information) is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Handling</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Uploads</strong>: Files uploaded (e.g., genetic reports) are stored in a secure environment, with access restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymization</strong>: Personal identifiers are anonymized when used in reports or exports to protect patient and contact privacy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
<li>Staging data is retained only until it is reviewed and transferred to the master database.</li>
<li>Master data is retained indefinitely unless deletion is requested by a user or required by law.</li>
</ul>
